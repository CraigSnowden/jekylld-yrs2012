        <h2>Participating in SAP Young Rewired State 2012</h2>
        
            <p>Hopefully you've came to this page, because you're interested in YRS, and want to know more.</p>

            <p>To take part in YRS, you need to have
            <strong>some</strong> knowledge of code, or spreadsheets,
            or some graphics skills. Don't worry if they're not too
            good, or if you've only been hacking for a couple of
            months. You'll learn more during YRS week. And have the
            support from others in the same boat as you &#8212; <strong>you
            are not alone</strong>.

            <p><strong>You will need a laptop</strong> throughout the
            week. If you have a preference for dev-tools, you will
            want those installed in advance.</p>

            <p>To take part in YRS, we need some information from you. Please fill out the form below, and we will allocate you to a centre or remote mentor. This form will close at 9pm on the 27th August, when the Olympic opening ceremony begins</p>
